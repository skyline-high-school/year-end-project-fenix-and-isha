MORE DETAILS FOR TRASH BASH (TRASH CLEANING GAME) IDEA:
- JavaFX for the graphics (because visually it should be simple enough for that to be fine)
- Classes (other than main and controller classes): pollution, trash (child), recycling (child), bin, trash bin (child), recycling bin (child), player (maybe?? it could be good if the game is two player or something, like to store color of trash bin and points collected by that player)
- could potentially try to make it 2-player (one player on WASD keys, one player on arrow keys) where you compete to see who can catch the most trash in a certain limited amount of time
- use of Random (for pollution objects spawning at random x-positions)
- use of TimerTask/Scheduling class
- JavaFX graphics tree manipulation (that's kind of a given though)
- game could get progressively harder (so the pollution objects fall increasingly faster, and more at a time, as time goes on / as the player gains more points), which could use TimerTask/Scheduling and/or recursion maybe? idk tbh
- could also get harder with stuff you're not supposed to catch (like fish or shark)
- use of recursion to handle the motion of the pollution objects? maybe? idk tbh

mental health support app
*  gratitude/goal/bucket list/other mental health benefitting lists, where you can get a prompt for each type of list 
      and add to it??? or do one everyday? idk. basically, it could offer prompts and give users a place to write 
      (and keep) their responses in an organized, concise, dedicated location

      instead its a trash bag and you're catching trash that's polluting the ocean/beach)

educational
*  maybe a simple game that teaches its players some coding concept (or helps them study it) 
      (doesn't need to be in an actual programming language, could just be a concept like logic gates, 
      loops/loop types, how recursion works, conditional types, basic searching techniques, basic sorting techniques, 
      maybe data types, etc.
