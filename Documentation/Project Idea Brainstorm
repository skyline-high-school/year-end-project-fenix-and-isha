Brainstorm for project ideas:
* = Fenix's top 3 fav ideas


mental health support app
*  gratitude/goal/bucket list/other mental health benefitting lists, where you can get a prompt for each type of list 
      and add to it??? or do one everyday? idk. basically, it could offer prompts and give users a place to write 
      (and keep) their responses in an organized, concise, dedicated location
game
  platformer?
  text-based game?
*  cleaning ocean plastic/trash pollution game (like those games where you have a basket that you move and catch falling fruit, except
      instead its a trash bag and you're catching trash that's polluting the ocean/beach)

hobby-related app
  story planner

educational
*  maybe a simple game that teaches its players some coding concept (or helps them study it) 
      (doesn't need to be in an actual programming language, could just be a concept like logic gates, 
      loops/loop types, how recursion works, conditional types, basic searching techniques, basic sorting techniques, 
      maybe data types, etc.
